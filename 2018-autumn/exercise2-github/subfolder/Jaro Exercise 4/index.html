        <div class="article"> <p><strong>Manchester (CNN)</strong> - Cristiano Ronaldo was the last player to leave the Old Trafford pitch, serenaded as he made his way to the tunnel by the Manchester United fans who had remained with a rendition of "Viva Ronaldo," the adaptation of the Elvis riff once commonplace on these terraces a decade or so ago.

The Juventus star had not played on the ground where he first made his name since the Sir Alex Ferguson years. On this floodlit Champions League night in England's north-west, he was warmly welcomed.

        <div class="article"> <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> Lionel Messi has fractured a bone in his right arm and will miss the El Clasico match against Real Madrid next week.

The Barcelona star landed awkwardly on his arm after colliding with Sevilla's Franco Vazquez in the first half of his side's 4-2 win Saturday. The Argentine received lengthy treatment on the pitch, and still looked to be in considerable pain as he left the field.
The Spanish giants later revealed Messi had suffered a "fracture of the radial bone in his right arm".

        <div class="article"> <p><strong>(CNN)</strong> Lewis Hamilton was left to rue his Mercedes team's tactics at the US Grand Prix, which forced the British driver to keep his champagne on ice for another week at least.

Hamilton could have clinched his fifth world title Sunday at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas, but a costly decision to pit twice meant he could only manage third place.

Hamilton needed to beat his now distant championship rival Sebastian Vettel by eight points, but the German overtook Mercedes'.
